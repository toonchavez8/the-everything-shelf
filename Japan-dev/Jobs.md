## About the Role

This is a product-driven, high-autonomy engineering role. You’ll work across the entire stack to design, build, and ship user-facing features used daily by professional animators and production teams. You’ll collaborate closely with designers, ML engineers, and founders, while also being trusted to independently take ideas from concept to production.

We’re looking for engineers who care deeply about shipping, have a strong JavaScript foundation, and can point to real products or systems they’ve built and delivered.

- Build and ship product-facing web applications with a strong focus on usability and performance  
- Develop and maintain backend APIs and services that support production workflows  
- Integrate ML inference endpoints and internal services via clean, reliable APIs  
- Move quickly in a scrappy environment while progressively hardening systems for scale  
- Collaborate with designers and artists to ensure tools match real studio workflows  
- Improve product quality through thoughtful refactors, testing, and system design  
- Help shape engineering standards, architecture, and development velocity as the team grows

- Experience building and consuming APIs (REST, WebSockets, etc.)  
- Strong product instincts with attention to users, edge cases, and maintainability  
- Able to work autonomously, take ownership, and make pragmatic tradeoffs  
- English fluency required; Japanese is a bonus  
- Based in Japan or willing to relocate (relocation support provided)
