WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE?
Machines, especially computer systems, simulate human intelligence
Processes with artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is used for
Expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, and
Machine vision, among other things.

FROM THE YEAR 1943-1952
IN 1943, WARREN MCCULLOCH AND WALTER PITS
PUBLISHED THE FIRST PAPER THAT IS NOW RECOGNIZED AS
Al. A MODEL OF ARTIFICIAL NEURONS WAS PROPOSED BY
THEM.
A RULE FOR UPDATING NEURONAL CONNECTIONS WAS
DEMONSTRATED BY DONALD HEBB IN 1949. HIS RULE IS
NOW CALLED HEBBIAN LEARNING.
A PIONEER IN MACHINE LEARNING IN 1950 WAS ALAN
TURING, AN ENGLISH MATHEMATICIAN. IN "COMPUTING
MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE", ALAN TURING PROPOSES
A TEST FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. A TURING TEST CAN
DETERMINE WHETHER A MACHINE CAN EXHIBIT
O
INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR EQUAL TO THAT OF A HUMAN.

FROM THE YEAR 1952-1956
THE FIRST ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM WAS
CREATED IN 1955 BY ALLEN NEWELL AND HERBERT A.
SIMON. IT WAS CALIED LOGIC THEORIST. DESPITE BEING
ABLE TO PROVE 38 OF 52 MATHEMATICS THEOREMS, THIS
PROGRAM WAS ALSO ABIE TO COME UP WITH NEW AND
ELEGANT PROOFS FOR SOME OF THESE THEOREMS.
A COMPUTER SCIENTIST NAMED JOHN MCCARTHY FIRST
USED THE TERM "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE" IN 1956 AT
THE DARTMOUTH CONFERENCE. FOR THE FIRST TIME, A 1
COINED AS AN ACADEMIC FIELD.
THAT TIME HIGH-LEVEL COMPUTER LANGUAGES SUCH
AS FORTRAN, LISP, OR COBOL WERE INVENTED. AND THE
ENTHUSIASM FOR A 1 WAS VERY HIGH AT THAT TIME.


O
1956-197
O
.IN 1966, THEERS FOCUSED 0 N
CREATING ALGORITHMS TO SOLVE
MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS. THE
't
FIRST CHATBOT WAS CREATED
JOSEPH WEIZENBAUM IN 1966,
AND WAS NAMED ELIZA.
.YEAR
1972:
THE
FIRST
INTELLIGENT HUMANOID ROBOT
WAS BIJILT IN JAPAN AND WAS
O
ALLED WABOT-I.
