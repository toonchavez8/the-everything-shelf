  # Bill Splitter App – Brief

Overview

Our company frequently places group food orders. Currently, we manually compare the receipt against our internal order list, then split the total among coworkers. This process is slow, error-prone, and confusing when handling exceptions like birthdays or shared items.

The Bill Splitter App will simplify this by allowing users to upload a receipt, match items with coworkers, and automatically calculate each person’s share.

Eliminate manual bill calculations.

Ensure fair and transparent splitting of group orders.

Employees place an order.

Receipt is uploaded.
